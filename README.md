           show main flow:
              1. Admin App â†” Backend for campaign management
              2. Backend stores/retrieves data
              3. Checkout Extension fetches active campaigns from Backend)

## Quick start (Dev)

### Prerequisites

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - Used to create a secure tunnel for Shopify to access your local development server. You will need your ngrok tunnel URL when setting up the app.
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/installation)
- [Shopify dev store with Plus plan](https://partners.shopify.com/) - Dev store with Plus features is not enough, Plus sandbox store needed
- [NodeJS v24+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Commands to setup

#### Install dependencies for backend and Shopify app:

```
cd backend && npm install && cd ../ && npm install && cd ../extensions/campaign-banner-extension && npm install && cd ../../
```

#### Disable store password on your Plus Sandbox store (Shopify Limitation). See Shopify guide: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/preferences/remove-password-protection

#### Setup the database

```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:generate && npm run prisma:migrate
```

#### Choose your Shopify env

Pull Shopify app environment config (from repo root, add reset flag only if you already have some apps connected):

```

shopify app dev --reset
shopify app env pull

```

Kill the terminal after first app dev command finishes

This will start the app, allow it to configure as needed, then pull down the env configuration locally.

#### Copy the secret from `.env.${app-name}` file for your env in root to `.env` in backend repository. Copy `.env.example to .env` if there is no `.env` in backend folder yet.

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

#### Start proxy

```bash
npm run backend:proxy
```

(runs the backend proxy script from `root/scripts`)

#### Start backend in backend folder

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### Start shopify app from repo root

```bash
npm run dev
```
